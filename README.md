A showcase of SOLID principles in C#.

## [Open-closed Principle](https://github.com/StevenGarberg/SOLID/tree/feature/OCP-refactor/SOLID.OCP)

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
